                    <p class="mb-2 text-sm">Over the last 2 years I have been a remote worker. I've never been a fan of working from home all day. Instead I enjoy walking my dog, Xabi, to a cafe to work from there.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2 text-sm">A big issue with this is knowing where allows dogs! It occurred to me from visiting many places that cafes, coffee shops etc often don't have outdoor areas and they certainly do not allow dogs inside.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2 text-sm">This was always really frustrating, and it was hard to find anywhere online which could help identify the places I could take Xabi. This is why I came up with the idea of making a site which showcases dog-friendly venues and also which ones allow dogs inside.</p>
                    <p class="mb-2 text-sm">I hope you enjoy the site!</p>
